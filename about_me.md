title: About Me!
---
Hey! I'm a first year student studying Mathematics and Computer Science, hoping to do a year in industry.
I have a wide experience in programming (and plan to expland my knowledge on programming!). I've used languages such as Python, Haskell, Java, HTML and CSS.
As a undergraduate, I feel I have strong transferrable skills from solving a problem independently to solving a problem in a team. I implement my existing skills into my part time job and any group projects (withiin / excluding University).
My GCSE's (2011 - 2016) were earned at Ridgeway High school. I earned 10 GCSE's varied from A - C. My A-Levels were earned at Birkenhead Sixth Form College which as varied from A - C.
My first semester of university, I achieved an overall mark of 75%.
Recently I took part in a Cybersecurity competition which was hosted by TryHackMe. In a team of 4, we were given tasks to complete which was set by the company and as a team we tackled these tasks. Our team placed top 15 out of 71 teams.
More information of my past experiences / projects are found on my linkedIn page. The link is on the left hand side.
