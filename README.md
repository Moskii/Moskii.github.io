# My Website
This repository contains the essential files for my website (containing my portfolio), accessble at https://moskii.github.io/. This was forked from Github own template (have a look at my stars for direct link). The website is made from Ruby and Jekyll (Static site). Server is ran from the terminal. Should be up 24/7 but expect changes now and then
## What Knowledge this gave me
- How Jekyll and ruby works
- Bit about HTML and CSS
