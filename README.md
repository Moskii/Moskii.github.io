# My Website
This repository contains the essential files for my website (containing my portfolio), accessble at https://moskii.github.io/. This was forked from Github own template (have a look at my stars for direct link). The website is made from Ruby and Jekyll (Static site). Server is ran from the terminal. Should be up 24/7 but expect changes now and then.
## What the website is built on and what it has access to
The website is mainly built on HTML and CSS however to run the website through Github and my terminal, the use of Ruby is required. The website is connected to Github so if I make any changes on my github, it will automatically render to my website.
## What I learnt
- How Jekyll(Liquid tags) and ruby works
- Bit about HTML and CSS
